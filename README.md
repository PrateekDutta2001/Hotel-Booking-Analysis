# Hotel-Booking-Analysis

Every year, more than 140 million bookings made on the internet and many hotel bookings made through top-visited travel websites like Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, etc. According to Google data, hotels are booked in advance of 12 weeks. 

This dataset contains 31 features about booking information such as Average Daily Rate, Arrival Time, Room Type, Special Request, etc. between 2015 and 2017 years. In this kernel, I would like to show some booking information details with exploratory data analysis, some feature engineering, reviewing correlations between features, hyperparameter tunning and visualizing most important features and their interesting distribution properties. 

As a result of all these analyses, I aim to find best model to predict hotel booking cancellations with tree-based algorithms based on rest of the features found in the dataset. 
The goal of predictive analysis is to avoid overfitting and find the model that has the highest accuracy.

# Hotel-Booking-Analysis

Every year, more than 140 million bookings made on the internet and many hotel bookings made through top-visited travel websites like Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, etc. According to Google data, hotels are booked in advance of 12 weeks. 

This dataset contains 31 features about booking information such as Average Daily Rate, Arrival Time, Room Type, Special Request, etc. between 2015 and 2017 years. In this kernel, I would like to show some booking information details with exploratory data analysis, some feature engineering, reviewing correlations between features, hyperparameter tunning and visualizing most important features and their interesting distribution properties. 

As a result of all these analyses, I aim to find best model to predict hotel booking cancellations with tree-based algorithms based on rest of the features found in the dataset. 
The goal of predictive analysis is to avoid overfitting and find the model that has the highest accuracy. 

Hotel industry is a very volatile industry and the bookings depend on variety of factors such as type of hotels, seasonality, days of week and many more. This makes analyzing the patterns available in the past data more important to help the hotels plan better. Using the historical data, hotels can perform various campaigns to boost the business. We can use the patterns to predict the future bookings using time series or decision trees.

Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

TYPES OF EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS: Univariate Non-graphical, Multivariate Non-graphical, Univariate graphical, Multivariate graphical.

Hyperparameter tuning is choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm. A hyperparameter is a model argument whose value is set before the learning process begins. The key to machine learning algorithms is hyperparameter tuning.
